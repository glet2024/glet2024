Hi, Iâ€™m Gus! I'm an undergrad student studying applied mathematics and computer science at Brown University (class of 2024).

I have a wide range of interests, but I'm particularly interested in compuational visualization of mathematical models and systems.

Feel free to reach out! You can contact me through my university email: gus_letourneau@brown.edu
