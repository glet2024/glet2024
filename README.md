Hi, Iâ€™m Gus! I'm an undergrad student studying applied mathematics and computer science at Brown University (class of 2024).

I have a wide range of interests, but I'm particularly interested in compuational visualization of mathematical models and systems.
From chaos theory to dynamical change within systems of differential equations, I am fascinated with how the intersection of computers and mathematics 
can reveal new discoveries and understandings that underpin how our world (and universe) functions.

Feel free to reach out! You can contact me through my university email: gus_letourneau@brown.edu
